# Project Context for Persistent Homology Analysis on BCL2 Protein Family

## Understanding Apoptosis and the BCL2 Family

Apoptosis, a critical physiological process, selectively eliminates cells to maintain health and prevent disease. The BCL2 family of proteins plays a pivotal role in the regulation of this process. Members of this family can be either anti-apoptotic, such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, and Mcl-1 in humans, promoting cell survival, or pro-apoptotic, like Bax and Bak, promoting apoptosis and maintaining the balance of cell death and survival.

## Aim of the Project

Our goal is to pioneer a novel approach for protein identification and characterization, utilizing persistent homologyâ€”a mathematical framework from Topological Data Analysis (TDA). This method transcends traditional sequence alignment and statistical modeling challenges posed by the diversity of BCL2 sequences across species.

## Significance of BCL2 Proteins

BCL2 proteins exhibit conserved patterns, including similar motifs, common intron positions, a transmembrane segment, characteristic hydrophobic profiles, and relatively conserved three-dimensional structures. These traits are utilized to validate BCL2 proteins post-identification using classical approaches like BLASTp and Hidden Markov Model profiling.

## Problematic

Traditional methods for identifying and classifying protein families are often complex and time-consuming. Our project introduces an innovative perspective by applying persistent homology to compute and analyze the topological features of protein structures represented as three-dimensional point clouds. By encoding these features into barcodes and employing distance measures like the Wasserstein distance, we can compare protein structures without sequence alignment.

## Project Overview

The research encompasses two distinct stages:

1. **Evaluation and Selection of Protein Structures:**
   We use sequences from our Reference Proteome to predict and evaluate 3D structures of BCL2 proteins using AlphaFold2. We focus on high-confidence structures to ensure the quality and reliability of subsequent analyses.

2. **Topological Data Analysis:**
   TDA, particularly persistent homology, is utilized to gain insights into the topology of BCL2 proteins. We automate the generation of barcodes for each structure and create a Wasserstein distance matrix, distributing these distances in a density plot to identify ranges that indicate significant structural similarity and a heatmap to visualize the pairwise distances between structures, revealing clusters and patterns of similarity within the protein family.

## Conclusion

The project endeavors to enhance the methods for protein family identification and classification. By adopting a topological perspective, we aim to add a new dimension to bioinformatics analyses, providing a more nuanced understanding of protein structure and function relationships.
