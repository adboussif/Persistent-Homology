# Dataset for Persistent Homology Analysis on BCL2 Protein Family

## Overview

This document provides details on the datasets used for the analysis of the BCL2 protein family through persistent homology. The datasets include sequences from a Reference Proteome of validated BCL2 proteins and a Control Proteome from well-characterized species.

## Datasets Description

### Reference Proteome (`bcl2_111_seq.fst`)
- **Description:** This dataset consists of 111 sequences of BCL2 proteins that have been validated and curated with the expertise of collaborator Nikolay Popgeorgiev.
- **Purpose:** To serve as a solid reference for our analysis, enabling the comparison and validation of potential BCL2 proteins identified in our study.

### Control Proteome
- **Description:** Comprises sequences from well-characterized proteomes of species like *Homo sapiens*, *Danio rerio*, *Drosophila melanogaster*, and *Caenorhabditis elegans*. The sequences are filtered based on their size (150 to 600 amino acids) from the PDB database.
- **Purpose:** To refine and validate the approach by filtering out less probable candidates for BCL2 proteins and managing data volume efficiently.
